# Introduction to statistic inference

We are using the data of an experiment replicated in ~30 laboratories across the world. The experiment is described [here](https://osf.io/wx7ck/) and the direct link to its original data [is this](https://osf.io/nqg97/). We are using a cooked version [available here](https://github.com/rcalinjageman/New_Stats_Teaching_Resources/tree/dae9981eb9a7bc373501a4ff9477498ee466ceac/workshop%20data/two_groups%20-%20iat/iat_data%20_csv), that was created by Robert J Calin-Jageman and his colleagues to the Teaching the New Statistics Workshop.

The first link study replicates many psychology experiments. The one we use here is "Sex differences in implicit math attitudes (Nosek, Banaji, & Greenwald, 2002). As a possible account for the sex gap in participation in science and math, Nosek and colleagues (2002) found that women had more negative implicit attitudes toward math compared to arts than men did in two studies of Yale undergraduates. Participants completed four Implicit Association Tests (IATs) in random order, one of which measured associations of math and arts with positivity and negativity. The replication simplified the design for length to be just a single IAT.".
