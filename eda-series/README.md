Exploratory data analysis with TV and Streaming Series from IMDB. The original data and variable were extracted from [this repository](https://github.com/nazareno/imdb-series), which also contains how the data was generated and what which variable means. This exercise was based in [this repository](https://github.com/cienciadedados-ufcg/eda-series).

The objective of the exercise is to have fun discovering what the general public thinks about the series episodes and seasons about series we like, and compare different series.
